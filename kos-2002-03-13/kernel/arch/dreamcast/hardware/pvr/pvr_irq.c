   PVR interrupt handler; the way things are setup, we're gonna get
   one of these for each full vertical refresh and at the completion
   of TA data acceptance. The timing here is pretty critical. We need
   to flip pages during a vertical blank, and then signal to the program
   that it's ok to start playing with TA registers again, or we waste
   rendering time.
