============================================================
Implemented
 - GB/GBC emulate with sound.
 - smooth sound with GBC. 
 - save support (with long filename support)
 - state save/load 
 - frameskip. 
 - screen adjustment. 
 - stable. 

Not yet
 - full speed on later GBC games. 
 - source code cleanup. 


----------------------------------------
** NOTE **
 VMU blocks use 

  most case: 
   - normal save: 3 blocks 
   - state save:  16-20 blocks

  worst case: (calculated by assuming compression had no effect)
   - normal save: 64 blocks
   - state save:  360 blocks


----------------------------------------
** STATE SAVE NOTE **

About quick state save: 
 quick-state-save shares savefile with all ROMs. 

 It's cleared when exit game 
(more exactly, it's cleared when load next ROM. 
so, remaining the quick state save data, even though you quit game, 
if you select the same ROM again.)


About VMU state save: 
 VMU-state-save makes a file per ROM. 

 It's saved to VMU, so you can load state after quit gnuboy/DC. 


============================================================
gnuboy filesystem hierarchy is

--------------------
    1st track (audio)
     audio.raw (or your favorite caution.wav)

    2nd track (data)
     /1ST_READ.BIN
     /pics/credits.bmp
     /pics/menu.bmp
     /pics/...
     /gb/zelda.gb
     /gb/favorite/mario.gb
     /gb/favorite/saga2.gb
     /gb/favorite/dqmonsters.gb
     /gb/rpg/saga1.gb
     /gb/rpg/saga2.gb
     /gb/rpg/saga3.gb
     /gb/loooooooooooong_filename

--------------------
** NOTE ** 
  - If you use Rock Ridge format, there is no limit for filename. 
  - Max ROM files is 1024 per one directory. 
  - gnuboy/DC doesn't support zipped ROMs.

How to compile

1. edit dcgnuboy-1.0.3-0.6/dcmake
2. dcmake in top dir


--------------------
** NOTE **

My develop environment

 * gnuboy/DC developing 
  - binutils-2.11.2
  - gcc-3.0.3
  - FreeBSD 4-stable

 * buring CD
  - NetBSD current
  - mkisofs + cdrecord

--------------------
** CAUTION **

I have no Windows PC, and I don't know HOWTO write CDs 
using Windows specific tools (DiskJuggler, Nero, ...).
